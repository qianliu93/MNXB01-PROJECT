delete useless header RootClasses.h -- QL

04:11:2012
New functions from WeatherDaraVec.h
double avgtemp();double maxtemp();double mintemp(); 
are used to simply the functions in monthly.C. -- QL
Made global_temperature_regression.C print more information to the console, and display axis titles
in the plot. Also added header files for both global_temperature_regression.C and avg_periodtemp.C -- CF

03:11:2021
Added features to Gregorian and WeatherDataVec classes, and compactified the code in corona.C -- DF
Fixed some bugs -- CF

02:11:2021
Added "global_temperature_regression.C", which tries to fit a linearly increasing sin function to given data.
Modified some of the utility classes to add some functionality. --CF

Added isempty to WeatherDataVec -- DF

Added more features to WeatherDataVec in particular avgtemp, mintemp, maxtemp --DF

Added a new class called Gregorian, this permits immediate addition of dates just initialize with Gregorian gDate {year,month,day};
Then you can freely add dates with gDate1 + gDate2. --DF

Added some more ways of accessing WeatherDataVec -- There are now two indexing operators [],(): 
--For WeatherDataVec Wdata we could have Wdata[5] or Wdata(5) both of which will return the 6th entry in data.
Furthermore Wdata(2,19) gives all entries from 2-19. Also, added Wdata.get_between() which takes two string arguments for the start and end date;
--and yields all dates in the intermediate range. --DF

Improve the classes Analyse_Monthly and Analyse_Corona, adding more parameters. --QL

Added a ROOT script called "avg_periodtemp.C" which contains a function "temperature_over_two_periods" taking 2 pairs of ints and a WeatherDataVec
as input. Using each pair of ints, it constructs a histogram containing the average temperature for each day of the period defined by the two ints,
then plots the resulting two histograms on top of each other. It also computes the average difference in temperature between the two time periods.
Also updated README.md with some improvements in formatting and a fixed typo.  --CF

Added some more methods to WeatherDataVec and WeatherDataLine, these are mostly for convenience such as a means of extracting data by regex--
and overloading the index operator [], in a similar vein I added the long overdue constructor method for WeatherDataVec immediately from filename. --DF

Encapsulated my functions from "monthly.C" into two classes:
class Analyse_Monthly    in    "monthly.h" & "monthly.C"
class Analyse_Corona    in    "corona.h" & "corona.C"
and improve rootlogon.C
--QL

24:10:2021
upload the 1st version root function to achieve the goals
the datapath in rootlogon.C may be modified since it is the absolute address to my system --QL

I added some headers today. Firstly, the header "csvregex.h" parses the raw data via regex. Secondly, the headers "WeatherDataLine.h" and "WeatherDataVec.h" -- 
provide nice wrappers for the data we are dealing with, in order to initialize the structures correctly just do something like the following:

//filename is the path to one of our raw ".csv" files
WeatherDataVec Wdata {datavec(filename)};

This provides immediate access to the data as a vector of WeatherDataLine, which encode the info of one line of the processed csv. To access the info within WeatherDataLine --
Just use one of the corresponding functions such as get_day().

IMPORTANT NOTE: it may very well be prudent to split up the header files into both .h and .cpp files, as they are currently quite short I deemed it unecessary;
and I think that we can keep the file for the WeatherDataLine class and for the miscellaneous functions for the csv parsing as is since I don't imagine they will grow in length.
However, we should consider whether or not to make a separate .cpp file for WeatherDataVec; this is probably the right thing to do depending on how we want to continue coding. -DF
