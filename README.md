# MNXB01-PROJECT
This is the project in the course MNXB01 2021 HT

All codes are based on Aurora. 

We use the following commands to load ROOT on Aurora:

```
module load GCC/5.4.0-2.26  
module load OpenMPI/1.10.3  
module load ROOT/6.10.02-Python-2.7.12
```
Compile the program with `make`.

To use the ROOT macros, first open the CLI by running `reg` in a command-line.
Then, simply run the commands corresponding to your desired computation (run `help` in the CLI to see a complete list). 

Team members: Carl-Fredrik Lidgren, Daniel Falkowski, Isak Ellmer, Qian Liu
